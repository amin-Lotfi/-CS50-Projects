        <p>It's strange how certain moments stick with you.</p>
        <p>
          I was only 11 when JJ3054 crashed near where I lived. I remember the
          events unfolding on TV.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time, I was too young and stupid to understand the gravity of
          the tragedy. All I could think about was the fact that Air Crash
          Investigation was such a cool show and maybe they would make an
          episode about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is far from being any fun, however. It's a homage to those lost
          in these tragedies and an opportunity to learn from them. Flying has
          never been safer, and it's thanks to the hard work of the people who
          investigate incidents and accidents.
