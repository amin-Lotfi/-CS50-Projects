This repository contains materials for **CS50**, Harvard University's introduction to computer science and the art of programming. It includes practice problems, labs, and problem sets for each week, along with a final project.

## Course Overview

CS50 teaches problem-solving both with and without code, emphasizing correctness, design, and style. The course covers computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and more. It starts with C, covering the fundamentals of programming and computer operations, then transitions to Python, explores SQL for database management, and finally introduces web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and related frameworks). The course also includes lectures on cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. At the end of the course, students must work on a final project where they design and implement a solution to a problem of their choice.
